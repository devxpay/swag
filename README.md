# RBKmoney OpenAPI Specification

The `release` branch contains [swagger.yaml](swagger.yaml) and [swagger.json](swagger.json) files built by a CI from the spec version on `master` branch. Check `master` commit id in a `release` commit message to correlate versions between the branches.

__The release branch is automatically handled by the CI and must not be meddled with by hand.__
